Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-
state can be calculated with the following formula:
Distance = Speed x Time
A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
• The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 15 hours
