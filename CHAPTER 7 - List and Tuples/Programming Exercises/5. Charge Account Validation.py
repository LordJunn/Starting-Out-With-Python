"""
If you have downloaded the source code from the Premium Companion Website you will
find a file named charge_accounts.txt in the Chapter 07 folder. This file has a list of a
companyâ€™s valid charge account numbers. Each account number is a seven-digit number,
such as 5658845.
Write a program that reads the contents of the file into a list. The program should then
ask the user to enter a charge account number. The program should determine whether
the number is valid by searching for it in the list. If the number is in the list, the program
should display a message indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the list, the
program should display a message indicating the number is invalid.
